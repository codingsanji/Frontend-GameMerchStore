# Game Merch Store for Phasmophobia and Valorant Merch ðŸš€ðŸŽ®  

IIn my first year at university, I dived into the world of web development and built a **Game Merch Store** from scratch as part of my coursework. This online store is equipped with all the necessary features, such as a sign-in and log-in page, a homepage, a dedicated selling page showcasing Phasmophobia and Valorant merchandise along with their respective information pages. 
The frontend is crafted using **React.js** and **TailwindCSS**, making it modern, sleek, and fully responsive! ðŸ’»âœ¨ 
The backend however is..... [WORK IN PROGRESS!!!]

## Progress  
At the time of committing this README file, the project is still a work in progress, but hereâ€™s whatâ€™s been accomplished so far:  
1. Skeleton structure of the frontend:  
   - **Homepage**
   - **Game Info Pages**  
   - **Merch Store Page**  
   - **Sign-Up and Log-In Pages**  
Stay tuned for updates as I continue to build and refine the project!  

## Shoutouts  
A huge shoutout to my teammate, who crushed it with the **Valorant advertising page and merch designs**. She also helped review the frontend and provided suggestions to improve its responsiveness and user-friendliness. You can check out her amazing work [here](https://github.com/absolutenobrainer333/WEB).  

Building this store has been an incredible journey, and I canâ€™t wait to bring it to life fully! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥
